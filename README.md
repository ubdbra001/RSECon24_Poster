# RSECon 24 Poster Repo

Poster outlining the PiCam/PyCam project and detailing my contributions to it.

Generated using [Typst](https://typst.app).  

## Notes

PDF generated on the website, but could also be produced using a local verson or the [VSCode LSP extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nvarner.typst-lsp).

The font used is [Noto Sans Display](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Display), but it may not be present on your system, and so Typst will fall back to a default font (Times New Roman?)
